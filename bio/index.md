####Bio

I am a NYC-based software engineer interested in systems and software security.

I graduated from Columbia University School of Engineering and Applied Science
(Class of '15) with a BS in Computer Science.

At Columbia, I worked as a research assistant to doctoral candidate Adam
Waksman and Professor Simha Sethumadhavan in the Computer Architecture and
Security Technologies Lab. With this group, I co-authored "FANCI:
Identification of Stealthy Malicious Logic Using Boolean Functional Analysis,"
a paper presented at ACM CCS 2013. This work led to the formation of ChipScan
LLC where I held the title of Lead Engineer from 2014 to 2015.

My language background is heavily rooted in Python with significant experience
in C, C++, and Java.

In my spare time, I play Ultimate Frisbee, read about consumer technology, and
travel.
