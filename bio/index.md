####Bio

I am an undergraduate at Columbia University School of Engineering and Applied
Science majoring in Computer Science. For more than two years, I have worked as
a research assistant to doctoral candidate Adam Waksman under Professor Simha
Sethumadhavan in the Computer Architecture and Security Technologies Lab.
During this time, I co-authored "FANCI: Identification of Stealthy Malicious
Logic Using Boolean Functional Analysis," a paper presented at ACM CCS 2013.

In the summer of 2012, I worked for Knewton, an Education-Tech Startup in New
York City. I helped roll out new features to their Python back end
infrastructure and contributed to a number of Open-Source projects used at the
company.

My language background is heavily rooted in Python and Java but I am competent
with a C compiler and Makefile or a Shell script.

I grew up in Manhattan and graduated from Hunter College High School in June
2011. In my spare time, I play college and club Ultimate Frisbee, read about
consumer technology, go to concerts, and build desktop PCs.
