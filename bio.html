                <p>I am an undergraduate at Columbia University School of Engineering and Applied Science
                majoring in Computer Science. For more than two years, I have worked as a research assistant
                to doctoral candidate Adam Waksman under Professor Simha Sethumadhavan in the Computer
                Architecture and Security Technologies Lab. During this time, I co-authored "FANCI:
                Identification of Stealthy Malicious Logic Using Boolean Functional Analysis," a paper
                presented at ACM CCS 2013.
                </p>
                <p>In the summer of 2012, I worked for Knewton, an Education-Tech Startup in New York City.
                I helped roll out new features to their Python back end infrastructure and contributed to
                a number of Open-Source projects used at the company.
                </p>
                <p>My language background is heavily rooted in Python and Java but I am competent with a
                C compiler and Makefile or a Shell script.
                </p>
                <p>I grew up in Manhattan and graduated from Hunter College High School in June 2011.
                In my spare time, I play college and club Ultimate Frisbee, read about consumer
                technology, go to concerts, and build desktop PCs.
